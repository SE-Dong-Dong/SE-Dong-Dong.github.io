        "Math rock is a style of alternative and indie rock with roots in bands such as King Crimson and Rush. \\n",
        "It is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, and extended chords.\\n",
        "Bearing similarities to post-rock, math rock has been described as the \"opposite side of the same coin\". Opting for a \"rockier\" approach to songwriting and timbres, the style is often performed by smaller ensembles which emphasize the role of the guitar"
