  "Stevie Ray Vaughan used to play guitar like a beast, and he had this habit of using super thick strings. How thick? Thick enough that most people would use them for bass, but he played lead guitar with them. The tension was insane, but it made his tone huge and punchy—exactly that sound that feels like it could rip the amp apart.",
  "The downside? His fingers got wrecked. Blisters, cuts, even split fingertips—it was brutal. But he had tons of shows and couldn’t take time off. So what did he do?",
  "He went hardcore: he literally glued his finger wounds with super glue to keep playing. Yep, he used that small bottle you can buy at the store. That glue basically turned his fingers into temporary “armor,” letting him get through show after show.",
  "People say half of SRV’s tone came from his fingers, but behind it all was basically thick strings + blood + super glue."
